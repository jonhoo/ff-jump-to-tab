A [Firefox
extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-jump-to-tab/)
that changed the hotkeys for switching between tabs from Alt+# to Ctrl+#
to align better with all the other [tab-related keyboard
shortcuts](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Keyboard+shortcuts#w_windows-tabs).
Sadly it looks like this will [never be fixed
upstream](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1389644); hence
this extension! It's based on @zbraniecki's
[this](https://gist.github.com/zbraniecki/000268ea27154bbccaad190dd479d226), 
but also makes Ctrl+9 jump to the last tab, and Ctrl+8 to the first
non-pinned tab.
